A few seats down at Loewe, The White Lotus creator Mike White sat alongside his season 1 and 2 actors Murray Bartlett and Theo James; meanwhile, The Idol co-stars Troye Sivan and Moses Sumney were fashion plates about town.(And if you‚Äôre curious as to how Skarsg√•rd‚Äôs tech overlord Lukas Matsson might feel about attending Fashion Week, the actor told GQ: ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôd be really excited about this for several reasons. He‚Äôs so hyper and he‚Äôs got a little bit of an attention deficit disorder, so I think this would really speak to him. ‚Ä¶ [This] would be a thrilling evening for Lukas.‚Äù)Scroll on to see the many, many major style moments from this month in Paris, Milan, and Florence.First published on gq.comThe man of the hour, sporting his own creations.
