If you invited a roomful of the most creative people on the planet to flip the idea of formalwear on its head, what kinds of looks would they come up with?The night’s attendees took the prompt to heart, arriving in a bonkers array of ultra-tailored tuxedos, luxury hoodies, out-there footwear, freaky jewelry, and at least one show-stopping leather-shorts-and-cowboy-boots combo. (Here’s looking at you, A$AP Ferg.) The 2023 GCA red carpet looks offer plenty of inspiration for the next time you’re called to don a tuxedo or a suit—even if you’re not quite gutsy enough to attempt shorts as evening wear. And lest we forget, it’s the dawn of wedding season—so if you see the words “festive black tie” or “creative black tie” written on an invite any time soon, consider that a challenge.Scroll on to see some of our favorite looks from the event below, and feel free to steal any fashion maneuvers that strike your fancy.Ian Isiah, the evening’s host, is creativity incarnate even when he’s not wearing a full Luar look, complete with gloriously hulking shoulders and fingerless gloves. (Luar designer Raul Lopez, also in attendance, wore a similar silhouette from his own collection.)The real kicker here are Isiah’s 24-karat gold nails by New York-based manicurist Dawn Sterling, aka @nailglam. Fingernails are one of our best blank canvases—if you’ve been feeling polish-curious, this is a new level to aspire to.GQ’s fashion director at large Mobolaji Dawodu dresses some of the world’s most stylish men—including, of course, himself. In this case, he put the global in Global Creativity Awards in a custom sherwani from Vintage India NYC.Layering a boxy, structured black leather blazer over an outré evening look with exaggerated cuffs and cut-outs, like best-selling author Mary H.K. Choi does here, is the key to being able to feel buttoned-up when you want to and slightly less so when you don’t.Artist Chase Hall’s vintage Hermès lapel-less cashmere opera coat is almost an optical illusion: at first glance it almost looks like he’s wearing a coat with tails, but upon closer inspection, you can see that it’s got all the luxurious ease of a robe.Bonus points for Hall’s simple color coordination with his partner, designer Lauren Rodriguez, who’s wearing a custom Martin Greenfield suit over a vintage Alaïa bra.According to basic color theory, red and green are complementary colors. But who needs theory when you have proof like GQ cover star Donald Glover’s plushly spherical Valentino shell jacket absolutely popping against the red carpet?There’s a similar principle at play here with model Alton Mason’s greenish-blue Tom Ford suit, which also pops against the red step-and-repeat backdrop. But more than that, this look is a lesson in monochromatism: The blue right runs from his boots right up to the lenses of his sunglasses.It’s all about that pocket!By Gaurav SonavaneBy Parth CharanActor Edgar Ramirez and model Abbey Lee bring a healthy dose of classic Hollywood glamor to New York City, thanks in no small part to some choice pops of red.The legendary chef-restaurateur’s creative take on the classic black-tie tux includes both a traditional cummerbund and funky Husbands boots.For a classic-made-contemporary kit, reference GQ global editorial director Will Welch’s custom Brioni suit as an elevated example of the current double-breasted jacket revival.By Gaurav SonavaneBy Parth CharanThe musician known as Del Water Gap takes the beloved Thom Browne skirt out for a red-carpet spin, inching us ever closer to total menswear skirt domination.When you have to hit the red carpet at 8 but need to attend a performance art event at 10, try an oversized Balenciaga suit with dainty turquoise satin ballet flats or a whimsical gown from the New York label Collina Strada. That’s Chef Danny Bowien and model-designer Sara Hiromi nailing downtown debonair.First published on gq.comBy Umaima SaeedBy Gaurav SonavaneBy  Saloni DhruvBy Gaurav SonavaneBy Gaurav SonavaneBy Sanjana RayBy Priyadarshini Patwa By Parth CharanMore From GQ IndiaCondé Nast India© 2023 Condé Nast.
