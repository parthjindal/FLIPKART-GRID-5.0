Some may make a lot of effort to dress well, some others may not take it too seriously. But all of us definitely take a cursory glance (at the least) to see if it is all in place - you don’t have to be interested in fashion to want to look good.Fashion is a form of self-expression. How we dress says a lot about who we are and how we’re feeling. Even the ones who don’t care about fashion are saying a lot about themselves by choosing to wear whatever they are wearing.Basically, there’s no escaping fashion, as long as you’re wearing clothes. So might as well make some effort, at least to not make grave fashion mistakes? Despite social media and magazines/websites - this one included - that are devoted to helping men dress well, the not-so-fair sex continues to make some basic mistakes that are so common, you’d think no man ever got the memo!If you don’t want to be one of those men, wake up and smell the coffee, or whatever other beverage that’s in fashion (pun intended).A tie is part of formal wear whereas a short-sleeved shirt isn’t. Putting the two together might seem attractive to you but it’s only as fashionable as those oversized sweaters from the 90s that are best forgotten to mankind.Square-toed shoes were designed as a one-style-fits-all pair that could accommodate toes of all shapes and sizes.

If your T-shirt is a bit too long, it isn’t the right size — tucking it in won’t make it look any better, even if you’ve seen your favourite actor do it on or off the screen.By Lucy FordIt’s either too big or too small, and both aren’t the right size. If you aren’t sure about your actual suit or blazer size, get yourself measured or seek the help of a stylist. Also, your size will keep changing with time - weight gain/loss, muscle development, etc. all alter your clothing size.Know the kind of hem that works best for you, and stick to it. Choose a hem basis your body type, height, and occasion. If it’s a formal one, go for a medium break where there’s a single fold across the ankle or a quarter break with a barely-noticeable one. If you aren’t too tall, a no-break hem works best. Taller men could carry off a full break where the hem runs all the way around the leg, though it’s only meant for casual occasions.Ranveer Singh's denim jacket in RARKPK costs more than iPhone 14 Pro Max8 colours uber-rich people & multi-millionaires avoid wearing; here's whyThe Dior Tears capsule collection tells a story of the journey of jazz, denim, and the preppy styleSkincare for men: 5 secrets every man should knowHere's why a white T-shirt continues to remain a wardrobe stapleBy Gaurav SonavaneBy Parth CharanBy Saumyaa VohraBy WIREDBy Lucy FordBy Sanjana RayMore From GQ IndiaCondé Nast India© 2023 Condé Nast.
