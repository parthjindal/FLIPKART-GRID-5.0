Not only is this the building that housed some of Conde Nast’s most iconic brands for over a decade, but Tarun Tahiliani’s sumptuous new menswear studio in Mumbai, located at the top floor, has the vibe of a royal library. Only, except for rows and columns of well-thumbed books, you have on display a collection of impeccably-cut garments, tailored for the modern Indian man. The studio, which spans the Dubash House fourth floor, is replete with wooden panelling, wooden flooring and a stunning square mandala within a square—designed specifically to imbue the space with an aristocratic air.Designed by Tahiliani – a man of impeccable taste – the studio is the brand’s very first dedicated menswear offering in the city. It opens with a foyer guarded by a striking antique yali sculpture. Reminiscent of the sphinx, the creature, set against a façade consisting of hand embroidered insects, black mother of pearl gardens and varied flora, appears unsettling at first glance, but functions as a symbol of power and protection. Stare at it too long and it is likely to pop up in your dreams later. To Tahiliani, it represents masculine energy at its finest—further showcased through the designer’s fresh, dramatic approach to his Sheer Summer Occasion-wear. As he puts it, men’s fashion is constantly changing and it’s important to cater to the demands for new silhouettes.Photo credit: Tarun Tahiliani“As larger-than-life celebrations become a norm, fashion has become something of great lightness, with much higher quality and finesse. Overtly heavy garments that weigh down the wearer, are no longer fun. With this new collection, we encourage men to wear the finest materials, in forms that they can party in while always staying supremely stylish”, he says.Despite this new, dramatic approach to traditional draping and sharp tailoring, the homage to Indian craftsmanship and textile heritage remains central to the Tahiliani philosophy. The new collection carries an aesthetic update to the more traditional Chikankari and refined detailing, as well as pieces in tulle, satin, georgettes, and tussars created in pastels on faded metallic tones, containing the TT signature motifs.Photo credit: Tarun TahilianiA musky scent pervades the studio, adding to its masculine aura, as a group of male models drift around the space showcasing the new collection. With its heritage ornaments, vintage chandeliers and wooden interiors—the new studio offers visitors an experience that is both cosy, and rarefied.The menswear studio is only a further expansion of Tarun Tahiliani’s footprint at Dubash House. The ground floor features an eclectic range of Tarun Tahiliani couture, with the expansive women’s section displaying a wide range of luxury pret, jewellery and accessories. The new menswear store on the fourth floor now adopts a masculine edge to his trademark style, while staying true to the contemporary Indian lifestyles, climate and traditions that form the core of his collection.Here’s what you should eat pre workout to help your body train harderThis happiness expert explains how to live a less stressful lifeHere's how Mark Zuckerberg got shreddedIntake of these 5 nutrients can slow down the premature greying of hair8 books you must read for career growthBy Che KurrienBy Samuel HineBy Umaima SaeedBy Umaima SaeedBy Samuel HineBy  Saloni DhruvBy  Saloni DhruvBy Sanjana RayMore From GQ IndiaCondé Nast India© 2023 Condé Nast.
