And it is this journey that Denim Tears founder Tremaine Emory is exploring in his latest collaboration with French luxury house Dior Men, a fall 2023 capsule collection called Dior Tears. The collection embodies a dialogue between Emory’s roots in New York and Paris where Dior is headquartered via New Orleans, the city that is considered the birthplace of jazz, which results in the collection being a perfect confluence of elegant, casual, and classic menswear.The basis of the collection is denim, which has French origins, coming from “serge de Nîmes”, a material created by weavers in Nîmes, France, who were trying to recreate a cotton corduroy from Genoa, Italy. On this heritage fabric, special jacquards and discharge prints have been developed and added to develop the collection, keeping the shapes of the 1950s. Emory, who is also the creative director of American streetwear brand Supreme, and much respected by his longtime friend and creative director of Dior Men Kim Jones, has incorporated French savoir-faire into the American archetype.The Dior Tears capsule, which was presented in December at the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, draws inspiration from the looks of Black Ivy League students from the 1950s and ’60s, and the nonchalant style of jazz musicians from the same period. There is also a nod to the civil rights movement, which happened simultaneously, where workwear was born. The collection hence features plaid shirts, varsity jackets, chinos paired with classic wool overcoats, tailored suiting, vintage hats, jewellery, cognac leather bags inspired by trumpet bags, and so on.Speaking about the story behind the capsule collection that is set to launch globally in July 2023, Emory said, “I want to share that moment in time where black writers, musicians, and artists were coming from America, running from America, and finding some level of acceptance in ­certain European cities and being able to have their art respected and who they are respected. It wasn’t perfect but it was just a moment, a beautiful moment for Blacks to have the ­privilege and opportunity to escape from the terror, the horrors of America, a degraded Jim Crow America. Artists like Miles Davis and writers like James Baldwin found refuge in Paris.”Ranveer Singh's denim jacket in RARKPK costs more than iPhone 14 Pro Max8 colours uber-rich people & multi-millionaires avoid wearing; here's whyThe Dior Tears capsule collection tells a story of the journey of jazz, denim, and the preppy styleSkincare for men: 5 secrets every man should knowHere's why a white T-shirt continues to remain a wardrobe stapleBy Samuel HineBy  Saloni DhruvBy  Saloni DhruvBy  Saloni DhruvBy Eileen CartterBy Sanjana RayBy The Editors of GQBy Samuel HineMore From GQ IndiaCondé Nast India© 2023 Condé Nast.
