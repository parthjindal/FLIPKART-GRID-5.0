After a certain age, what made you desirable and fun in your twenties is deemed crudely immature and your roles begin to go to the glossiest new pageant winners. Neena Gupta has always managed to avoid that descent into timidness, which shines through in her bold and vivacious personal style, replete with bright colours and unusual silhouettes. She recently wore an outfit centred around the classic Little Black Dress, proving that timeless styles can also be age-defying.This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The actress was photographed outside a party wearing a square-necked black dress with thin spaghetti straps that she had paired with thigh-high black suede boots. Her styling was as glamorous as her outfit as she opted for gold chandelier earrings, a studded black evening bag, and big sunglasses with yellow-tinted lenses. Gupta had tied her hair in a low-rise bun and opted for soft glam makeup.The LBD has always been hailed for its sophisticated allure and versatility. But that seductive charm has always been reserved for younger women—the femme fatales in old noir films, a youthful and gamine Audrey Hepburn, and forever teenager Betty Boop. Gupta’s look proves that the LBD can still exude that same class and elegance regardless of what age. Women are never praised online for “aging like wine” in the same way men like George Clooney are, but if there’s ever a female version of the silver fox archetype, Neena Gupta should become its poster child - because whatever it is, she’s got it.HELMUT LANG Square neckline minidressPARIS TEXAS Vegas 100mm suede thigh-high bootsISHARYA Amara Double Lattice EarringsALEXANDER MCQUEEN Studded Textured Leather Shoulder Bag5 surprising things we learnt about Neena Gupta's journey through her conversation with Kareena Kapoor Khan20 pictures that give you a closer look at Neena Gupta's age-agnostic styleNeena Gupta sported this Carrie Bradshaw approved Balenciaga bagBy Devki Bhatt By Melanie PauknerBy Sheree Gomes GuptaBy Rosalind JanaBy Rochelle PintoBy Rochelle PintoSee more storiesCondé Nast India© 2023 Condé Nast.
