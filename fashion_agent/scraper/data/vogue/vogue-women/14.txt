Florence Pugh was seen enjoying the sets by Sugababes, Fat Boy Slim and Christine and the Queens.The Oppenheimer actor packed an assortment of dopamine-boosting ensembles that were a departure from her sleek red-carpet dresses. Pugh documented her maximalist festival style in a carousel of snaps shared on Instagram: in one image, she rocks a neon green bodysuit layered over a hot pink bikini set, complemented by a pink feather-trimmed cowboy hat and blue fuzzy-rimmed shades.This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Another shot finds Pugh in a head-to-toe pink ensemble, combining a neon sheer halter-neck bodysuit over a bikini, accentuated with a glittery biker jacket. This look might have been an homage to Valentino’s genius creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, who recently unveiled an entirely hot pink collection (or “Pink PP”, to give the shade its official title). Piccioli – who has dressed Pugh on myriad occasions and made her the face of the brand in April – was seen reacting with heart and flame emojis in the comments section of the post.Elsewhere, the actor opted for a polka-dotted pink jacket, paired with a leopard print fedora hat adorned with feathers and matching square-frame leopard-rimmed shades.
